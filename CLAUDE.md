## Diff Engine Capabilities

### Similarity Algorithms
1. **Name Similarity**: Edit distance, Jaccard similarity, substring matching
2. **Signature Similarity**: Parameter and return type comparison  
3. **Structural Similarity**: Kind, visibility, and size analysis
4. **Location Similarity**: Proximity-based scoring with exponential decay
5. **Documentation Similarity**: Text analysis with concept extraction
6. **Semantic Similarity**: Context and relationship analysis

### Heuristic Rules
1. **CamelCase Heuristic**: Component addition/removal/reordering detection
2. **Prefix/Suffix Heuristic**: Common prefix/suffix pattern analysis
3. **Abbreviation Heuristic**: Abbreviation/expansion pattern detection
4. **Refactoring Pattern Heuristic**: Extract method, clarity, convention alignment
5. **Contextual Heuristic**: Location proximity and usage pattern analysis

### Dependency Analysis
- **Multi-language support**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Python, Java, C#
- **Import pattern detection**: Regex-based and language-specific detectors
- **Circular dependency detection**: Graph-based cycle detection
- **Change categorization**: Add, remove, modify, move operations
- **Impact assessment**: Risk levels and suggestion generation

## API Integration Points

### Diff Engine API
```go
type DiffEngine interface {
    CompareFiles(ctx context.Context, oldFile, newFile *types.FileInfo) (*DiffResult, error)
    CompareSymbols(ctx context.Context, oldSymbol, newSymbol *types.Symbol) (*DiffResult, error)
}
```

### Configuration Options
```yaml
diff_engine:
  semantic_diff: true
  structural_diff: true  
  rename_detection: true
  dependency_tracking: true
  similarity_threshold: 0.7
  rename_threshold: 0.8
  max_diff_depth: 10
  timeout: 5s
```

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2.2**: Implement multi-level caching for performance optimization
2. **Phase 2.3**: Add watch mode with debounced file change handling  
3. **Phase 3**: Build Virtual Graph Engine with shadow/actual graph pattern
4. **Phase 4**: Implement Compact Controller with intelligent optimization
