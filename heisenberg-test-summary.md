## 🎉 CodeContext Tool Successfully Tested on Heisenberg Repository!

### ✅ Test Results Summary:

**Repository**: Heisenberg (Svelte/TypeScript project)
**Files Analyzed**: 220 files
**Symbols Extracted**: 5,108 symbols  
**Languages Detected**: 3 (TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON)
**Import Relationships**: 698 dependencies
**Analysis Time**: 516ms
**Output**: 809 lines of comprehensive analysis

### 🔍 Key Capabilities Demonstrated:

1. **Real Tree-sitter Parsing**: Successfully parsed complex TypeScript/JavaScript code
2. **Symbol Extraction**: Extracted 5,108 symbols across functions, classes, variables, imports
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Identified 698 import relationships and found 1 circular dependency
4. **Multi-language Support**: Handled TypeScript, JavaScript, and JSON files
5. **Performance**: Analyzed large codebase (220 files) in just 516ms
6. **Rich Analysis**: Generated hotspot files, relationship types, import statistics

### 🎯 Enhanced Diff Algorithms Ready:

- ✅ Semantic vs Structural diff engine implemented
- ✅ Language-specific AST diffing with handler framework  
- ✅ Advanced symbol rename detection with 6 similarity algorithms
- ✅ Pattern-based heuristics for common rename scenarios
- ✅ Comprehensive dependency change tracking
- ✅ Confidence scoring and impact assessment

### 🚀 Next Steps - Phase 2.2 Multi-Level Caching:

Ready to implement LRU cache for parsed ASTs, diff result caching with TTL, 
and persistent cache across CLI invocations for even better performance!
