### ADR-003: Virtual DOM Pattern for Incremental Updates
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Accepted  
**Context:** Need efficient incremental updates for large repositories

**Decision:** Implement Virtual DOM-inspired architecture for graph updates

**Rationale:**
- **Performance**: O(changes) instead of O(repository_size) complexity
- **Proven Pattern**: Virtual DOM successful in React ecosystem
- **Memory Efficiency**: Shadow graph smaller than full regeneration
- **Batching**: Natural support for batching multiple changes
- **Rollback**: Easy to implement undo/rollback functionality
- **Debugging**: Clear separation between virtual and actual state

**Components:**

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Accepted  
**Context:** Need efficient caching for parsed ASTs

**Decision:** Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with TTL (Time To Live) for AST storage

**Rationale:**
- **Memory Management**: LRU automatically manages memory usage
- **Freshness**: TTL ensures cache doesn't serve stale data
- **Performance**: Avoids re-parsing unchanged files
- **Simplicity**: Well-understood caching strategy
- **Configurable**: Can tune size and TTL based on needs

**Cache Configuration:**
```yaml
cache:
  max_size: 1000          # entries
  ttl: 1h                 # time to live
  eviction_policy: lru    # least recently used
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **No Caching**: Simple but poor performance
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Complex to implement correctly
- **FIFO**: Simple but poor hit rates
- **Persistent Cache**: Complex, potential corruption issues

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Excellent performance for repeated file access
- ✅ Predictable memory usage
- ✅ Simple to implement and understand
- ❌ Cache misses still require full parsing
- ❌ Memory overhead for cache metadata

- **Readable**: Clear input/output relationships
- **Efficient**: Shared setup and teardown code

**Test Structure:**
```go
func TestFunction(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    InputType
        expected OutputType
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        // test cases...
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Individual Test Functions**: More verbose, harder to maintain
