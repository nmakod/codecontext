```
Week 1: 40% - Basic Dart syntax parsing
Week 2: 60% - Flutter widget detection
Week 3: 75% - Advanced Dart language features  
Week 4: 85% - Dart 3.0+ modern features
Week 5: 90% - Flutter framework intelligence
Week 6: 95% - Async and advanced patterns
Week 7: 98% - Performance optimization
Week 8: 100% - Complete feature parity
```
